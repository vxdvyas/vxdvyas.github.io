# Portfolio Website v1.0.1 - MechaSamurai Edition

Welcome to the latest version of my personal portfolio website, featuring a unique "MechaSamurai" theme. This project showcases my skills, experience, and projects in an interactive and visually engaging way.

## New in v1.0.1: Mobile Experience
This update brings comprehensive mobile responsiveness to the entire portfolio, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

### Mobile Responsive Features
- **Homepage HUD Interface**: The desktop experience transforms into a sleek, mobile-optimized command center. Navigation buttons (Projects, Contact, Resume) are moved to the top, while section shortcuts flanking the MechaSamurai convert to compact text buttons for touch-friendly navigation.
- **Optimized Layouts**: All pages (About, Education, Experience, Skills, Certifications) now feature vertical stacking, touch-optimized spacing, and improved readability on smaller screens.
- **Virtual Joystick**: The  minigame now detects mobile devices and automatically enables an on-screen virtual joystick for movement control, replacing keyboard inputs.
- **Smart Footer**: The footer is now position-aware on mobile, appearing naturally at the bottom of the scrollable content.

## About the Project
This portfolio is designed to be a digital representation of my professional journey. The "MechaSamurai" theme combines traditional Japanese aesthetics with futuristic sci-fi elements, symbolizing the blend of foundational knowledge and cutting-edge technology.

_"We will try to activate it..."_ - This reflects the ongoing evolution and planned future enhancements for this platform.

## Tech Stack
The website is built using standard web technologies without heavy frameworks to ensure performance and custom styling control:
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and content.
- **CSS3**: Custom styling, animations, and the implementation of the MechaSamurai theme (including fonts like "Cinzel", "Noto Serif JP", and "Orbitron").
- **JavaScript**: Interactive elements, sliders, modal logic, and navigation handling.
