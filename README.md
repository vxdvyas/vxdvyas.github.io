# Portfolio Website v1 - MechaSamurai Edition

Welcome to the first version of my personal portfolio website, featuring a unique "MechaSamurai" theme. This project showcases my skills, experience, and projects in an interactive and visually engaging way.

## About the Project
This portfolio is designed to be a digital representation of my professional journey. The "MechaSamurai" theme combines traditional Japanese aesthetics with futuristic sci-fi elements, symbolizing the blend of foundational knowledge and cutting-edge technology.

_"We will try to activate it..."_ - This reflects the ongoing evolution and planned future enhancements for this platform.

## Tech Stack
The website is built using standard web technologies without heavy frameworks to ensure performance and custom styling control:
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and content.
- **CSS3**: Custom styling, animations, and the implementation of the MechaSamurai theme (including fonts like "Cinzel", "Noto Serif JP", and "Orbitron").
- **JavaScript**: Interactive elements, sliders, modal logic, and navigation handling.

## License & Assets
**Ownership License**:
All assets used in this repository, including but not limited to images, graphics, icons, and videos (e.g., `mechasamurai.png`, `samuraiglow.png`, project screenshots), are under strict ownership license.
