            <p class="description">I completed my secondary education at St. Kabir School, 
                <br>   where I was also a student from pre-primary through primary levels. 
                <br>   Being introduced to computers as a subject from Class 1 sparked my early 
                <br>  interest and long-standing passion for technology. 
                <br>  Alongside academics, the school played a vital role in shaping my 
                <br> communication skills, teamwork, and value-based learning.
                <br>  I gained a strong foundation in languages, mathematics, science, and 
                <br>other core subjects, which collectively contributed to my overall personal
                <br>and academic development.

            <p class="description">I later attended Tree House High School, where, driven by my passion 
                for pursuing engineering, I chose the science stream. I studied Physics, Chemistry, and 
                Mathematics along with Computer Studies, gaining exposure to both theoretical concepts 
                and practical applications. During this time, I also actively prepared for the JEE, 
                which further strengthened my analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and commitment 
                to a rigorous academic routine. This phase taught me a lot, as it helped me develop discipline, 
                resilience, and a structured approach to learning while balancing in-depth theoretical studies
                 with practical understanding. It also clarified my career goals, and prepared for the challenges 
                 of engineering education ahead.</p>
